                    BooksRus, a bookstore chain with an annual book sales volume
                    of 2,000 books, serves approximately 1,500 customers, and
                    generates $100,000 in revenue annually. An online sales
                    tracker system, utilizing a relational database, is created
                    to enhance the chainâ€™s sales tracking capabilities and
                    improve inventory management. This system will efficiently
                    record Invoices, capturing details of Books purchased by the
                    Customers across its 5 Stores located throughout the United
                    States. Additionally, the database schema accommodates
                    scenarios of multiple Authors per book, multiple purchases
                    for a single book, and the association of purchases with
                    specific customers and stores.
