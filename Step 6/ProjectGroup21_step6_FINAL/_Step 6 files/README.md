The purpose of this project is to create an online sales tracker system for BooksRus, a bookstore chain, to enhance their sales tracking capabilities and improve inventory management. The system aims to efficiently record invoices, capturing details of books purchased by customers across the chain’s multiple stores located throughout the United States. Additionally, the system’s database schema is designed to accommodate scenarios involving multiple authors per book, multiple purchases of a single book, and the association of purchases with specific customers and stores. The collected and stored data will enable the business to conduct various analytics in the future to gain valuable insights that can help the business grow.
